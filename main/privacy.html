            1. The publisher of the linked app or page is ServiceMedia, a private Texas Corporation, whose principal officer is James Presnal Cherry, of Austin, Texas.  For more information contact jim@servicemedia.net.  
            </p><p>
            2. User authentication may be required to access some of the ServiceMedia content, and this user information is stored on the servers controlled by ServiceMedia.  User activity tracking by ServiceMedia on the linked app or page is limited to authentication and resource usage. User emails may be used for authentication, and cookies or tokens may be used to store authentication session information on the apps and websites, but is stored and used only for access control purposes.
            </p><p>
            3. To support geolocation of content, some app scenes or web pages may request access to the user's physical location.  These requests and their results are used only for object placement or access control purposes, and are not collected or stored, or correlated with specific users.  Subscribers have the ability to create scenes that contain geolocation information, and restrict access to these scenes based on the user's physical location, but this runtime user location data is not collected or stored. 
            </p><p>
            4. For Augmented Reality (AR) scenes, the app may request access to the device's camera, and to support saving screen captures, the app may request access to the user's photo gallery. The app does not read or access photos already on the device in any way.  Guest users and subscribers may take screen captures in the apps at runtime, which are stored only on their device, in the photo gallery, where users may do with them as they wish - but they are not automatically uploaded or stored in any other place. 
            </p><p>
            5. ServiceMedia does not share or sell user data of any kind.
            </p>

        6. The content on the linked page or app is not intended for children under the age of 18.
